# World-Weather-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project consists on 3 technical analysis
  1. Retrieve weather data from different cities
    Generating 2k random latitudes and longitudes, we will retrieve the nearest corresponding           city and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherApp. For each city the weather info will be put into a dataframe.

  2. Create a customer travel destinations map
     We will ask specific conditions that the customer wants in order to retrieve a list of cities that make a perfect recommendation to travel to.
      
  3. Create a travel itinerary map
     According to each selected city a travel itinerary will be generated in order to plan the whole trip.
